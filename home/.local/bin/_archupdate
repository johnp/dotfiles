# These two steps may be run before a transaction snapshot is (conditionally) created (e.g. by snapper)
# Note: this is not strictly necessary, when snapper deletes no-diff snapshots
#       (to achieve no-diff, at least /var/{cache,log,temp} should be excluded / on different subvolumes)
# Update package database
# pacaur -Sy
# Check if there are any updates available (includes AUR and -git packages)
