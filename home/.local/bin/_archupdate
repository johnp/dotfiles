# _archupdate: A script for updating Archlinux using pacmatic, yay and pacdiff.
#              See the respective man-pages for their functionality.

# To prevent snapper/btrbk from making nearly essentially no-diff snapshots on
# package checks without update, these likely need to be on subvolumes or excluded
# otherwise: /var/{cache,log,tmp}, $XDG_CACHE_HOME, $HOME/.cache
