# archupdate: A tmux wrapper around _archupdate.
#   As the shell `_archupdate` runs in could be killed, e.g. by an X server crash, this script executes
#   it inside a temporary, via script(1) recorded tmux command session that, after it closes itself and
#   clear(1)s the screen, is reprinted to the terminal for easy viewing in the scrollback.
#
#   This also conveniently resolves two issues that are caused by isatty(1) returning false when stdout
#   is redirected, namely having no colored output unless forced manually and progress bars not working.
